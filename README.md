# lucene-net-example
This is an example of some wrapper, indexing, and search techniques using Lucene.net, to make it easy to implement in your own application.

It is a little fancy, as the SearchService uses generics and attributes to find the search fields and identifier. This could be simplified if you're only going to use this for indexing a single data type. But, the work is done here, and it would probably take longer to implement it without generics anyway.

:magic:
